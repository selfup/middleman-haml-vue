# HAML, Sass, Redux, and VueJs using Middleman.

* Using Redux for state management
* Currently only using reducers
* Will use defined action modules shortly
* Using Vue templates and passing down props to child components
* Every HAML view should only have an entry point for Vue to inject itself into
* The rest should be handled by Vue
